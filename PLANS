Planned things to do in sorttable v3

Full test suite
Publish test suite and make it easy for someone to run it and report back
Track runs of the test suite and record data (google analytics?)
Maintain "does not need a library"
Maintain "just include sorttable and it works without configuration"
Maintain compatibility back to IE6
Sort on page load
Handle colspanned rows (http://kryogenix.org/days/2013/07/26/why-sorttable-doesnt-handle-colspanned-rows)
Polyfill HTML5 sortable attribute (http://www.whatwg.org/specs/web-apps/current-work/multipage/tabular-data.html#table-sorting-model)
Move config options to data-* attributes
Handle multiple sortable tables on a page
Show arrows on page load
Handle multiple header rows
Handle empty rows/cells
Provide debug console to see what sorttable is doing
Make JSHint clean
Obfuscate </script> in comment to avoid breaking older Firefoxes.
Replace literal high-bit-set characters in regexp with escapes to avoid unicode hassle: if (text.match(/^-?[\xA2\xA3\xA5\u20A5\u20B9\u20AC\u20A1\u20B5\x24]?[\d,.]+%?$/)) or similar
Work when there are more then 256 rows (added to test suite)
Accessibility stuff
Fix getinnertext to work with many different types of content (unicode, html, emptiness, text)
Fix mixed content warning in I by not using javascript:void as link dest: use :// instead or similar
Numeric comparisons are the wrong way around: should be bb-aa not aa-bb
A cell with a single "," in it makes sorttable diagnose the column as containing floats. See email from Michel R
